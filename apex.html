    <h2>
        My experience

    </h2>
    <h3>
        Apex to me is my top game at the moment. It is a fun and competitive game made with skill in mind(sometimes).</br>
        I have played the games since the second sy it came out. I have played over  hours and have streamed myself playing sice Feb 2020.</br>
        Te game has kept me playing and i dont plan on stopping. By far the competitivness and fun aspect has made me pick it as my number one game.
